    "\n",
    "*This tutorial aims to teach the basics of (bio-)image processing with python, in particular the analysis of fluorescence microscopy data. The tutorial is self-explanatory and follows a \"learning by doing\" philosophy. It consists of step by step instructions that guide students through the construction of a 2D single-cell segmentation pipeline.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook contains detailed instructions on how to program a pipeline that can segment cells in 2D fluorescence microscopy images of a developing tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simply go through the instructions step by step and try to implement each step as best as you can.\n",
    "    - By doing so, you will learn about key concepts of (bio-)image processing with python!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are stuck...\n",
    "    - ...first think some more about the problem and see if you can get yourself unstuck.\n",
    "    - ...search the internet (in particular Stack Overflow) for a solution to your problem.\n",
    "    - ...if you are working through this tutorial in class, ask one of the tutors for help.\n",
    "    - ...if nothing else helps, you can have a look at the solutions (`image_analysis_tutorial_solutions.py`) for inspiration.\n",
    "        - **Beware:** If you simply copy a solution, you will learn *nothing* in the process! Use the solutions only as an inspiration for implementing your own version and make sure you fully understand how the solution works!\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "- Some exercises are labeled as 'BONUS' exercises. It is up to you whether you'd like to complete them. \n",
    "    - If things are going slowly, you may want to skip them and come back to them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to construct a pipeline for the identification and segmentation of cells in 2D confocal fluorescence microscopy images of a tissue with labeled membranes. This is among the most common tasks in bio-image analysis and is often essential for the extraction of useful quantitative information from microscopy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline is constructed based on provided example images (see `example_data` directory), which are single-color spinning-disk confocal micrographs (objective: `40X 1.2NA W`) of cells in live zebrafish embryos in early development (~10h post fertilization), fluorescently labeled with a membrane-localized fusion protein (`mNeonGreen:Ggamma9`)."

    "- Depending on your preferences, there are several alternatives for implementing this pipeline:\n",
    "    1. Implement it directly in this Jupyter notebook *[recommended]*.\n",
    "    2. Implement it in your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm.\n",
    "    3. Old School: Implement it in a text editor (like Vim...) and run it on the terminal.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Example Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you have downloaded the example image data (`example_cells_1.tif` and `example_cells_2.tif`), which should be located in the directory `example_data`, which in turn should be in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python version\n",
    "\n",
    "- The solutions are provided in **python 3.6** (but any version of python 3 should work without changes)\n",
    "- Everything shown in the solutions also works in python 2.7 with only very minor changes.\n",
    "- To install python, jupyter notebook and the required modules, we recommend the **Anaconda Distribution**. The installer can be downloaded [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required modules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure the following modules are installed before you get started:\n",
    "    - numpy\n",
    "    - scipy\n",
    "    - matplotlib\n",

    "\n",
    "- Deconvolution\n",
    "    - Image reconstruction based on information about the PSF of the microscope\n",
    "    - These days deconvolution is often included with microscope software\n",
    "    - *Our example images are not deconvolved, but will do just fine regardless*\n",

    "- Conversion to 8-bit images to save memory / computational time\n",
    "    - *Our example images are already 8-bit*\n",

    "- Cropping of images to an interesting region\n",
    "    - *The field of view in our example images is fine as it is*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smoothing of technical noise\n",
    "    - This is a very common step and usually helps to improve almost any type of downstream analysis\n",

In our example image, for instance, the intensity drops at the image boundaries - a problem that cannot be resolved just by changing the threshold value.\n",

This is a small binary image where all pixels set to `1` will be considered as part of the neighborhood and all pixels set to `0` will not be considered. Here, we use a disc-shaped `SE`, as this reduces artifacts compared to a square `SE`.\n",

However, we cannot use it to measure intensities at the membrane of the cells, nor can we use it to accurately measure features like cell shape or size.\n",

    "To improve this (and to resolve cases of under-segmentation), we can use a \"seeding & expansion\" strategy. Expansion algorithms such as the `watershed` start from a small `seed` and \"grow outward\" until they touch the boundaries of neighboring cells, which are themselves growing outward from neighboring seeds. Since the \"growth rate\" at the edge of the growing areas is dependent on image intensity (higher intensity means slower expansion), these expansion methods end up tracing the cells' outlines."

    "A `seed image` contains a few pixels at the center of each cell labeled by a unique `ID` number and surrounded by zeros. The expansion algorithm will start from these central pixels and grow outward until all zeros are overwritten by an `ID` label. In the case of `watershed` expansion, one can imagine the `seeds` as the sources from which water pours into the cells and starts filling them up.\n",

    "For multi-channel images that contain a nuclear label, it is common practice to mask the nuclei by thresholding and use an eroded version of the nuclei as seeds for cell segmentation. However, there are good alternative seeding approaches for cases where nuclei are not available or not nicely separable by thresholding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use a `distance transform` for seeding. In a `distance transform`, each pixel in the foreground (here the cells) is assigned a value corresponding to its distance from the closest background pixel (here the membrane segmentation). In other words, we encode within the image how far each pixel of a cell is away from the membrane (see figure below). The pixels furthest away from the membrane will be at the center of the cells and will have the highest values. Using a function to detect `local maxima`, we will find these high-value peaks and use them as seeds for our segmentation.\n",

As the water level rises, the seed expands - until it finally reaches the 'crest' of the cell membrane 'mountain range'.
