    "\n",
    "*This tutorial aims to teach the basics of (bio-)image processing with python, in particular the analysis of fluorescence microscopy data. The tutorial is self-explanatory and follows a \"learning by doing\" philosophy. It consists of step by step instructions that guide students through the construction of a 2D single-cell segmentation pipeline.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook contains detailed instructions on how to program a pipeline that can segment cells in 2D fluorescence microscopy images of a developing tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simply go through the instructions step by step and try to implement each step as best as you can.\n",
    "    - By doing so, you will learn about key concepts of (bio-)image processing with python!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are stuck...\n",
    "    - ...first think some more about the problem and see if you can get yourself unstuck.\n",
    "    - ...search the internet (in particular Stack Overflow) for a solution to your problem.\n",
    "    - ...if you are working through this tutorial in class, ask one of the tutors for help.\n",
    "    - ...if nothing else helps, you can have a look at the solutions (`image_analysis_tutorial_solutions.py`) for inspiration.\n",
    "        - **Beware:** If you simply copy a solution, you will learn *nothing* in the process! Use the solutions only as an inspiration for implementing your own version and make sure you fully understand how the solution works!\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "- Some exercises are labeled as 'BONUS' exercises. It is up to you whether you'd like to complete them. \n",
    "    - If things are going slowly, you may want to skip them and come back to them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to construct a pipeline for the identification and segmentation of cells in 2D confocal fluorescence microscopy images of a tissue with labeled membranes. This is among the most common tasks in bio-image analysis and is often essential for the extraction of useful quantitative information from microscopy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline is constructed based on provided example images (see `example_data` directory), which are single-color spinning-disk confocal micrographs (objective: `40X 1.2NA W`) of cells in live zebrafish embryos in early development (~10h post fertilization), fluorescently labeled with a membrane-localized fusion protein (`mNeonGreen:Ggamma9`)."

    "- Depending on your preferences, there are several alternatives for implementing this pipeline:\n",
    "    1. Implement it directly in this Jupyter notebook *[recommended]*.\n",
    "    2. Implement it in your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm.\n",
    "    3. Old School: Implement it in a text editor (like Vim...) and run it on the terminal.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Example Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you have downloaded the example image data (`example_cells_1.tif` and `example_cells_2.tif`), which should be located in the directory `example_data`, which in turn should be in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python version\n",
    "\n",
    "- The solutions are provided in **python 3.6** (but any version of python 3 should work without changes)\n",
    "- Everything shown in the solutions also works in python 2.7 with only very minor changes.\n",
    "- To install python, jupyter notebook and the required modules, we recommend the **Anaconda Distribution**. The installer can be downloaded [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required modules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure the following modules are installed before you get started:\n",
    "    - numpy\n",
    "    - scipy\n",
    "    - matplotlib\n",

    "\n",
    "- Deconvolution\n",
    "    - Image reconstruction based on information about the PSF of the microscope\n",
    "    - These days deconvolution is often included with microscope software\n",
    "    - *Our example images are not deconvolved, but will do just fine regardless*\n",

    "- Conversion to 8-bit images to save memory / computational time\n",
    "    - *Our example images are already 8-bit*\n",

    "- Cropping of images to an interesting region\n",
    "    - *The field of view in our example images is fine as it is*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smoothing of technical noise\n",
    "    - This is a very common step and usually helps to improve almost any type of downstream analysis\n",
