# Bioimage Analysis Workshop Taipei (README.md)

The course materials for the bioimage analysis workshop at Academia Sinica, Taipei. Please note that these materials have been heavily adopted from:

- **EMBL Bio-IT bioimage analysis workshop**, especially the part by Toby Hodges and Jonas Hartmann: [https://git.embl.de/grp-bio-it-workshops/image-analysis-with-python](https://git.embl.de/grp-bio-it-workshops/image-analysis-with-python)
- **Introduction to Bioimage Analysis** by Pete Bankhead: [https://bioimagebook.github.io/](https://bioimagebook.github.io/)
- **Bioimage Analysis Lecture 2020** by Robert Haase: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-2DbkUwKk4&list=PL5ESQNfM5lc7SAMstEu082ivW4BDMvd0U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-2DbkUwKk4&list=PL5ESQNfM5lc7SAMstEu082ivW4BDMvd0U)

## Pre-requirement of the workshop

Please prepare the following before the workshop:

- Please install Anaconda ([https://www.anaconda.com/](https://www.anaconda.com/)) on your laptop (Yes, you need a laptop) and follow the ‚ÄúCreating a Python Environment for the workshop‚Äù workflow below for the setup.
- If you are not comfortable with python, please follow the ‚ÄúBasics in Python‚Äù Jupyter notebook to learn the basics of python programming
- If you want something more to get yourself more comfortable with python programming for image processing, follow ‚ÄúBasics in Python2‚Äù Jupyter notebook.

## Creating a Python Environment for the workshop

1. With the Anaconda prompt, create a virtual environment with the name ‚Äúbioimage-analysis‚Äù
    
    ```powershell
    conda create --name bioimage-analysis python=3.8
    ```
    
2. Then activate the environment
    
    ```powershell
    conda activate bioimage-analysis
    ```
    
3. Install all the necessary packages
    
    ```powershell
    conda install numpy matplotlib scipy scikit-image ipywidgets
    ```
    
    then
    
    ```java
    jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension
    ```
    
4. In anaconda navigator, change the environment to the newly created environment
    
    ![Untitled](Bioimage%20Analysis%20Workshop%20Taipei%20(README%20md)%20713e3db33cf646a6b17ca62c7449b647/Untitled.png)
    
5. Install Jupyter Lab (Or Jupyter notebook) in this environment
6. Launch the Jupyter Lab (Or Jupyter notebook) and navigate to the downloaded files

## Past events

I am happy to report that I have successfully run this event twice. The first event was for the Neuroscience Program at Academia Sinica (NPAS) on January 4th, 2023 and had over 25 attendees, mostly with backgrounds in neurosciences. The second event was for the Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology (ICOB) and Institute of Biological Chemistry (IBC) which was open to all at Academia Sinica, on January 11th, 2023. This event had over 50 attendees from various backgrounds including plant biology, biochemistry, cell biology and biophysics.
